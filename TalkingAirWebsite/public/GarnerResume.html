     <p><span style="font-size:125%; font-weight:bold;">An Overview of James K <span style="font-style:italic;">(Chip)</span> Garner’s Career</span>
    <br />
    <br />
         Chip Garner, the founder and principal of Garner Total Energy, began his engineering career as a member of the 
         TRW Energy Development Group in the early 80’s, using FORTRAN to analyze aspects of fusion and fusion-fission 
         hybrid reaction conceptual designs. 
     <br />
         Space Station Solar Dynamic Power systems were his next challenge with the TRW Space and Technology Group and 
         before the decade’s end, he was managing TRW’s Systems and Payloads Engineering Department, providing systems 
         engineering analysis and software support to several NASA and DOD electro-optical space instrument programs. 
     <br />
         In the early 1990’s as a Senior Engineer with Science and Engineering Associations, Inc., Chip focused on nuclear 
         safety projects but by 1993 he began to weave together his passion for soaring and sail planes with his career 
         activities as a consultant, systems designer, analyst and independent businessman. 
     <br />
         Since that time, except for a 22 month stint coordinating engineering efforts in Germany and Santa Fe as a 
         Project Manager for Thermo Electron (A Division of Thermo Fisher Scientific) Chip has consulted on and designed 
         software, initially calling his firm Soaring Innovations and focusing on projects related to soaring and sailplanes.  As business activity reached beyond software for flight instrumentation, he renamed the firm Santa Fe Software, the predecessor to Garner Total Energy.
