        | We are leveraging advancing sensor technology and new IoT tools to create a personal air quality monitor.  (Google IoT
        | if you have not heard of the Internet of Things.)
        | IoT may have reached its hype peak, but this has resulted in the creation of many new tools
        | that are exactly what we need to
        | lower the cost of producing sensors that work well and are connected to the internet.
        | New hardware and software tools are being developed and released continually from major companies including:
        | IBM, Intel, Microsoft, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co., Foxconn Technogology Group and MediaTek.
      p
        | We are currently in the design phase.  The sensors should measure PM25, ozone, and VOCs as this includes the
        | pollutants we are most likely to encounter outdoors and indoors.  Ozone and VOCs are relatively easy to measure
        | using well calibrated semiconductor sensors.  Particles, especially small particles, are harder to measure accurately.

        | (SensorName) will upload or stream data to a mobile phone or PC.  USB can be used for communicating and charging.
        | Bluetooth or wireless, possibly both, will allow streaming and uploading data. (SensorName) needs to be able to store
        | data when no connection is available.  We are using the Intel Edison in testing which easily meets all these requirements.

        | Air quality is now available in much of the world, and both the number of stationary monitoring stations and
        | the availability of the data are increasing.  See 
        a(href='http://aqicn.org/') AQICN
        |  (Air Quality Index China, although they now include
        |             most of the world) for data and news about improving monitoring.  Many countries are now displaying their data using
        |             the Air Quality Index, or AQI, developed by the EPA in the United States.

          | AQI is based on several measurements and the worst result is reported.  For example,
          | some cities may have very high levels of ozone in the afternoon and this can dominate other pollutants.
          | The biggest problem in much of the world today is very fine particles, called PM 2.5 for particulates less than
          | or equal to 2.5 microns in size. These particles are small enough to go deep into your lungs and even enter your bloodstream.

          | Air pollution data is occasionally available from satellites and often from monitoring stations all over the world.
      p
        | The negative health effects of PM2.5 were not recognized until fairly recently, and it is also relatively difficult to
        | measure. Many modern monitoring sites don't measure PM2.5 at all and will sometimes report a much better AQI
        | than if they included PM2.5.  The middle picture below shows Paris (on a good day) with several green readings and a few
        | in the yellow.  Closer inspection shows that the none of the green sites are measuring PM25. (More data thanks to AQICN.)
