          | Many people are concerned about eating the right foods and exercising. What we
          | breath matters too. Air pollution is a health problem in much of the world today. You can often take action
          | to reduce your exposure. You can also help to improve the environment directly by conserving energy, and
          | indirectly by supporting the right legislation.

          | Air pollution is more pervasive than you might think. Current station measurements are not
          | on the street or in your home; no one is monitoring the air you actually breath.
        p(style='padding-left:20vw;width:65vw')
          | Being able to measure the air quality directly where and when you are breathing will allow you to make informed
          | decisions to reduce your exposure.  For example, take a different road with less traffic or do your high intensity
          | exercise where the air is best.  If more air quality data is publicly available people will be able to make better decisions
          | about how to prevent it.  If more people hear about it more people will care about it and take action.
